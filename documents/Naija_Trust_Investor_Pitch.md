## 1. The Problem: The Trust Deficit
**"Trust is the currency of commerce, but in Nigeria, inflation has hit trust hard."**

*   **For Consumers**: Fear of "What I Ordered vs. What I Got" scams prevents millions from shopping online or trying new service providers.
*   **For Businesses**: Legitimate SMEs struggle to differentiate themselves from scammers. Good businesses die because they cannot prove their credibility to new customers.
*   **The Gap**: Instagram comments are messy, Twitter (X) dragging is chaotic, and Google Reviews lacks local verification context.

## 2. The Solution: Naija Trust
**"A Centralized Verification & Reputation Platform for Nigeria."**

Naija Trust is the "Yelp + Better Business Bureau" for the African market.

*   **Verified Identity**: We don't just list businesses; we verify them. Consumers see a "Green Badge" and know this business exists and is registered.
*   **Two-Way Resolution**: Unlike social media mob justice, we provide a structured channel for businesses to reply to reviews and resolve disputes professionally.
*   **Data-Driven**: We give businesses analytics on who is viewing their profile, turning reputation into actionable insights.

## 3. Market Opportunity
*   **Target Mobile Market**: Nigeria has over 100M+ internet users, with a rapidly growing e-commerce sector.
*   **SME Sector**: There are over 40 million MSMEs in Nigeria, most of whom rely on Instagram/WhatsApp and desperately need a "Trust Badge" to convert sales.
*   **Vertical expansion**: Starting with Service Providers & Retail, expanding to Real Estate and Artisans.
