# Naija Trust: Business Sales Pitch & Strategy

**Goal:** Convince legitimate Nigerian businesses to Claim their Profile and Subscribe.

---

## 1. The "Hook" (Why they need us)

**The Problem:**
"In Nigeria today, even legitimate businesses lose customers because people are scared of scams ('What I Ordered vs What I Got'). If a customer doesn't trust you instantly, they scroll past you."

**The Solution:**
"Naija Trust is Nigeria's verification standard. When customers see our **Green Verified Badge** on your profile, they know you are real, registered, and reliable."

## 2. Key Value Propositions (What they get)

### A. Instant Credibility (The Badge)
*   **Pitch:** "Stop trying to convince strangers you are real via DM. Send them your Naija Trust link. The 'Verified' badge does the selling for you."
*   **Feature:** Verification Checkmark + "CAC Registered" tag.

### B. SEO Domination (Google Visibility)
*   **Pitch:** "When people search 'Is [Business Name] legit?', what do they see? A random Nairaland thread? Or a professional Naija Trust profile with 5-star ratings?"
*   **Feature:** Our pages are SEO-optimized to rank high on Google Search.

### C. Crisis Management (Control the Narrative)
*   **Pitch:** "Bad reviews happen. On Twitter, a bad review is a roast. On Naija Trust, it's a conversation. We give you the tools to **Reply officially** and solve the issue, turning a hater into a loyal customer."
*   **Feature:** Official "Business Owner" replies.

### D. Analytics (Know Your Customer)
*   **Pitch:** "Do you know how many people looked for you today? We do. Our dashboard shows you exactly how many Profile Views and Website Clicks you are getting."
*   **Feature:** Business Dashboard with real-time graphs.

## 3. The Pitch Script (Cold DM / Email)

**Subject:** Is [Business Name] verified on Naija Trust?

"Hi [Name],

I’m a big fan of what you’re doing with [Business Name].

I noticed you have a strong reputation, but when I searched for you online, there wasn't a central place verifying your credibility to new customers.

I founded **Naija Trust** to help legitimate businesses like yours stand out from the noise (and the scammers).

I’ve already created a draft profile for you. You can **claim it for free** here: [Link]

**Claiming allows you to:**
1.  Get the 'Verified' Green Badge (Trust).
2.  See how many people are searching for you (Analytics).
3.  Reply to customer reviews officially.

It takes 2 minutes. Let’s get you verified so your customers buy with confidence.

Cheers,
[Your Name]"

## 4. Objection Handling (FAQ)

**Q: "Why should I pay? I have Instagram."**
**A:** "Instagram is for pictures. Naija Trust is for **Credibility**. Anyone can open an Instagram account and post stolen pictures. Only a real business can get Verified on Naija Trust. It proves you are not a scam."

**Q: "What if people write lies about me?"**
**A:** "That is exactly why you need to claim your profile. Right now, if they lie on Twitter, you can't control it. On Naija Trust, you get an alert, and you can reply officially with facts. We also have moderation to remove hate speech."

**Q: "I already have Google Reviews."**
**A:** "Google is great for maps, but Naija Trust is Nigerian-specific. We verify CAC registration and handle local context better. Plus, we actively feature top-rated businesses to our community."
